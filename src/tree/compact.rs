//! Prediction-optimized tree layout.
//!
//! [`RegTree`] keeps every node attribute (gain, cover, categorical ranges) in
//! a 40-byte node, and traversal branches on the split outcome. For batch
//! prediction that is dominated by branch mispredictions: split directions are
//! data dependent and essentially unpredictable, so each level costs a pipeline
//! flush. [`CompactForest`] re-lays every tree of an ensemble out for a
//! branch-free walk, in one shared node arena:
//!
//! - nodes are renumbered breadth-first so the two children of a node are
//!   adjacent, letting the step compute `next = left + (go_right as u32)`
//!   arithmetically. Child indices are absolute within the arena, so lanes
//!   walking different trees share one base pointer.
//! - every numeric split is expressed as one ordered compare `v' > cond'` that
//!   is false for missing values (`NaN`): a split whose missing values go left
//!   stores `cond' = next_below(cond)` (so `v > cond'` is `v >= cond`), and a
//!   split whose missing values go right stores the children mirrored with
//!   `cond' = -cond` and reads the negated feature value (`-v > -cond` is
//!   `v < cond`).
//! - values and thresholds are compared as monotone unsigned integer
//!   [`key`]s, which keeps the whole step in integer registers: load, load,
//!   compare, add. A missing value's key is `0`, below every real key, so it
//!   never compares greater. Batch rows are stored as keys of `v` and of `-v`
//!   side by side ([`FEATURE_LANES`] per feature), and a mirrored node simply
//!   addresses the negated half, so no per-step sign flip is needed.
//! - leaves store `cond' = +inf` and point at themselves, so a walk can run a
//!   fixed number of steps (the tree depth) without testing for termination.
//!   Several rows (or, for a single row, several trees) are walked in lockstep
//!   so their dependent load chains overlap.
//!
//! Leaf ids are arena indices, and [`CompactForest::original_id`] maps them back
//! to [`RegTree`] node ids for `predict_leaf`.
//!
//! A vector-leaf tree's leaves store, instead of their value's bits, the offset
//! of their weight vector in a shared arena ([`CompactForest::accumulate_vector`]);
//! the walk itself is unchanged.
