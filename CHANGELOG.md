All notable changes to `sequoia-boost` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Runtime-dispatched AArch64 NEON kernels for objective gradients, prediction
  transforms, metric reductions, and dense numeric histogram split evaluation.
  Scalar fallbacks handle other CPUs, short inputs, and values outside the
  approximation ranges.
- Runtime-dispatched x86-64 kernels: an AVX2+FMA dense split-gain scan whose
  division-free prefilter hands surviving candidates to the exact scalar test
  (split choices are bit-identical), AVX2 exponential, sigmoid, logistic
  gradient, and short softmax (2 and 4 classes) kernels, and an SSE2 16-cut
  search for quantile binning. On x86-64 the histogram bin sums keep the scalar
  summation order.
- Kernel and tree-building benchmarks with reproducible comparisons and
  [documented results](docs/performance.md).
- Benchmark charts in the [performance guide](docs/performance.md): XGBoost
  speedup and fit time by thread count, plus scalar-baseline time cuts for
  full training, tree builds, and pointwise gradients, transforms, and
  metrics. The SVGs are rendered by `docs/benchmarks/charts.gp` from
  `docs/benchmarks/xgboost.dat` and `docs/benchmarks/optimization.dat`.

- `autoresearch.sh`: the canonical benchmark entrypoint. It builds the
  deterministic training and inference workload in
  `examples/autoresearch_bench.rs` (dense, wide, binary, multiclass, and
  sparse/missing training; batch prediction; TreeSHAP), runs the test suite
  as a correctness guard, and reports one `METRIC` line per workload across
  thread counts.

### Changed

- Skip child histograms and split searches for depthwise leaves at `max_depth`,
  preserving leaf statistics, monotone bounds, and column-sampling order.
- Parallelize quantile cuts, bin assignment, and depthwise node construction.
  Size histogram tasks to the available rows and reuse final training-row
  partitions in smaller thread pools.
- Rewrite prediction around a lazily built branch-free tree layout: breadth-first
  node arena, single-compare split encoding with mirrored default-right
  children, sixteen-row (or sixteen-tree) lockstep traversal, block-parallel
  batches, and per-block densification of sparse rows. `predict`,
  `predict_margin`, `predict_leaf`, and single-row prediction are 10× to 20× faster
  with identical results.
- Speed up TreeSHAP contributions and interactions 8× with an arena-backed
  decision path, precomputed cover fractions, hoisted divisions, a shared
  unwound sum for off-path elements, and row-parallel evaluation.
- Compare prediction splits on monotone `u32` keys (NaN maps to the missing
  direction, mirrored nodes read a precomputed negated key) loaded together
  with the node's feature slot in one 64-bit load; batch prediction is
  25–35% faster with identical results.
- Build the two children's split evaluations concurrently on large nodes and
  reduce partial histograms in parallel by bin range, keeping the per-bin
  addition order. Root histograms over contiguous row ranges are built
  column-wise with one writer per feature; sibling partitions are written into
  spare capacity instead of zero-filled buffers.
- Compute built-in row-independent gradients (squared error, logistic, softmax)
  over fixed row chunks in parallel, bit-identical to the whole-batch result.
- Evaluate TreeSHAP hot path elements in monomorphized lanes, skip the unit
  `one_fraction` division, and reuse the parent's path region for the cold
  child, for a further ~5% reduction with per-element results unchanged.

### Fixed

- Make the AArch64 NEON dense split scan bit-identical to the scalar scan. Its
  vector prefilter compared a bound that could overflow to infinity — where
  `inf > inf` reads false — or round subnormal, silently dropping candidates
  the scalar scan accepts; the prefilter now saturates its bound and routes
  subnormal products and intermediates to the exact check. Surviving
  candidates are also accepted with the scalar `calc_gain` arithmetic, which
  scores zero-Hessian children with a zero gain instead of rejecting them, so
  the chosen split, statistics, and loss match the scalar scan and the x86-64
  kernel bit for bit.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Correct DART tree normalization to use the learning rate in the normalization
  denominator.
- Enforce interaction constraints in exact trees and isolate features omitted
  from configured interaction groups.
- Make `multi:softmax` return one class label per row while preserving the
  probability matrix returned by `multi:softprob`.
- Include DART weights, early-stopping limits, dataset base margins, and linear
  boosters in SHAP contributions and interaction values.
- Reject malformed datasets, invalid objective labels, incompatible evaluation
  sets, invalid early-stopping settings, and prediction feature mismatches with
  structured errors instead of panics or silently ignored inputs.
- Honor per-row base margins in `gblinear` and honor `nthread` with a scoped
  Rayon pool.
- Interpret explicit count, Gamma, and Tweedie base scores in reported-value
  space and pass configured Poisson `max_delta_step` into its Hessian.
- Add query-level ranking weights and use them when averaging NDCG and MAP,
  matching XGBoost's ranking-weight semantics.
- Reject XGBoost JSON export for DART, `gblinear`, and categorical models that
  cannot be represented correctly by the current exporter.
- Replace the unmaintained bincode native serializer with Postcard. Native
  binary blobs from 0.1.0 are not compatible with 0.2.0. JSON remains the
  portable native interchange format across these versions.
- Return `Result` from margin-limited and leaf prediction APIs so feature-count
  and base-margin mismatches cannot silently produce predictions.

### Changed

- Prepare version 0.2.0 citation, Zenodo, and Cargo release metadata. No DOI is
  claimed until the first Zenodo archive has been published.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release: a faithful, pure-Rust reimplementation of XGBoost gradient
boosting.

### Boosters & tree construction
- Boosters: `gbtree`, `dart` (tree dropout), `gblinear` (coordinate descent).
- Tree methods: `exact`, `hist` (histogram + subtraction trick), `approx`
  (hessian-weighted per-round binning), plus `depthwise` and `lossguide` growth.
- Sparsity-aware missing-value handling, row and column subsampling
  (`bytree` / `bylevel` / `bynode`), and multi-core histogram construction (`rayon`).

### Objectives & metrics
- Objectives: `reg:squarederror`, `reg:pseudohubererror`, `reg:gamma`,
  `reg:tweedie`, `count:poisson`, `binary:logistic`, `multi:softmax`,
  `multi:softprob`, learning-to-rank (`rank:pairwise` / `rank:ndcg` / `rank:map`,
  LambdaMART), plus a custom-objective hook.
- Metrics: `rmse`, `mae`, `logloss`, `error`, `auc`, `aucpr`, `mlogloss`,
  `merror`, `ndcg`, `map` (with `@k`), `poisson/gamma/tweedie-nloglik`, plus a
  custom-metric hook.

### Modeling
- Monotone constraints and interaction constraints (both `hist` and `exact`).
- Native categorical splits (both `hist` and `exact`).
- Per-instance `base_margin` (warm-start / stacking), early stopping, feature
  importance (weight / gain / cover / totals).
- TreeSHAP feature contributions (`predict_contribs`) and interaction values
  (`predict_interactions`).

### I/O & tooling
- Loaders: libsvm, CSV, dense/CSR in-memory.
- Model I/O: native binary + JSON, and XGBoost-format JSON import/export.
- K-fold cross-validation.

### Quality
- Unit, property (`proptest`), and doc tests. XGBoost model-quality parity is
  verified in CI against real XGBoost.
