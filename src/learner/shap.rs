//! Exact per-prediction feature attributions via TreeSHAP.
//!
//! This implements the path-dependent, exact TreeSHAP algorithm of Lundberg et
//! al., *"Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles"*,
//! matching XGBoost's `pred_contribs=True`. For a single tree the returned
//! per-feature values sum to `f_tree(x) - E[f_tree]`, where the expectation is
//! taken over the tree's cover (Hessian) distribution. The missing offset
//! `E[f_tree]` is folded into the bias term. Summed over the whole ensemble the
//! contributions therefore satisfy the exact-additivity property
//!
//! ```text
//! Σ_j contribs[j] + bias == margin(x)
//! ```
//!
//! where `bias == base_score[k] + Σ_tree E[f_tree]` for output `k` and
//! `margin(x)` is the model's raw margin ([`BoostedModel::predict_margin`]).
//!
//! The core recursion is the standard `O(T · L · D²)` algorithm (`T` trees, `L`
//! leaves, `D` maximum depth): each root-to-leaf traversal maintains the set of
//! unique features seen so far together with their `zero`/`one` fractions and a
//! permutation weight, using the EXTEND / UNWIND operations to add and remove
//! features as the path forks.
